| FR-001         | User Registration & Login          | As a new user, I want to register with my email and password, so that I can create an account and log in to book bikes.                                      | User is able to sign up with email and password, receive success message, and log in using those credentials. Invalid logins show appropriate error messages.                                     |
| FR-002         | View Available Bikes               | As a logged-in user, I want to view all available bikes with their current status so I can choose the one I want to rent.                                   | Dashboard shows list of available bikes from the fleet including bike name, status (available/reserved/under maintenance), and basic specifications.                                               |
| FR-003         | Make a Reservation                 | As a user, I want to select a bike and make a reservation for a specific time so I can ensure it is available when I need it.                              | Reservation form accepts time and date; bike is marked as "reserved" and shown in user's dashboard with confirmation. Prevents double-booking for same bike/time.                                  |
| FR-004         | Cancel Reservation                 | As a user, I want to cancel my reservation if my plans change so the bike becomes available to others.                                                      | Cancelled reservations update bike status to "available" and remove the entry from user dashboard. Confirmation message is shown to user.                                                         |
| FR-005         | Payment Processing                 | As a user, I want to securely pay for my reservation so that I can complete the booking process.                                                            | Simple form collects payment amount and method (COD or basic card form), stores transaction in DB. Reservation only confirms if payment is recorded.                                              |
| FR-006         | Fleet Management (Admin)           | As an admin, I want to manage the fleet by adding, updating, or removing bikes from the system.                                                             | Admin panel provides forms to add new bikes with name, type, status; update existing bike info; delete bikes from fleet. All changes reflect in availability list.                                |
| FR-007         | Maintenance Scheduling (Admin)     | As an admin, I want to schedule maintenance for bikes, so that we keep our fleet in good condition.                                                         | Bikes can be marked "under maintenance" for given dates; such bikes are hidden from public availability during that period. Admin sees all maintenance logs.                                       |
| FR-008         | Damage Reporting                   | As a user, I want to report if a bike is damaged after my ride so that it can be fixed before someone else uses it.                                         | A form allows users to submit damage details with optional photo and description. Admins see damage reports and can update bike status to "under maintenance".                                   |
| FR-009         | User Dashboard                     | As a logged-in user, I want a dashboard where I can see my current and past bookings, and access options like cancellation or damage reporting.            | Dashboard displays list of bookings with status, times, and options to cancel, report damage, or make a new booking.                                                                               |
| FR-010         | Admin Dashboard                    | As an admin, I want a dashboard to view the entire fleet, reservations, payments, and damage reports in one place.                                         | Admin sees panels for bikes, users, reservations, payments, and damage logs, with links to edit/update entries.                                                                                   |
| FR-011         | Logout Functionality               | As a logged-in user, I want to log out securely so that no one else can access my account on a shared device.                                              | A logout button terminates session and redirects to login page. Session tokens are destroyed from the server side.                                                                                 |
| FR-012         | Responsive Frontend Design         | As a user, I want the website to look good and work well on both mobile and desktop devices.                                                               | All pages styled using Tailwind CSS with responsive layouts. Forms, cards, buttons adjust properly to screen sizes using standard breakpoints.                                                     |
